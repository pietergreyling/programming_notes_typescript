# TypeScript Programming Notes

These notes help to aid my short term memory.

## Types, Interfaces, Classes!

### Types
- a type is low level
- types are closed 
- types cannot be augmented
- types can be composed into a new type

### Interfaces
- an interface is high level
- interfaces are open
- interfaces can be augmented
- interfaces can be merged and remain the same interface
- interfaces can implement multiple interfaces

### Classes
- classes are high level
- a class can implement interfaces
