# TypeScript Programming Notes

These notes help to aid my short term memory.

## Types, Interfaces, Unions, Classes!

### Types
- a type is low level
- types are closed 
- types cannot be augmented
- types can be composed into a new type

### Interfaces
- an interface is high level
- interfaces are open
- interfaces can be augmented
- interfaces can be merged and remain the same interface
- interfaces can implement multiple interfaces

### Unions
- A union type describes a value that can be one of several types. We use the vertical bar ( | ) to separate each type, so number | string | boolean is the type of a value that can be a number , a string , or a boolean.

### Classes
- classes are high level
- a class can implement interfaces
